In this post, I address a shader implementation of Horn-Schunck's optical flow in 24 draw-calls.

## Limitations

### Assumptions

The original optical flow algorithm assumes the scene has brightness constancy and small changes. Therefore, it breaks on large movement (i.e. low-fps footage) and scenes with varying illumination.

### Iterations

Pixel shaders are not known for being the best for traditional stationary iterative solvers like Jacobi. These solvers use small kernels in dozens of iterations to get good results. These traditional schemes are simple, can are slow on the GPU due to fillrate and draw-call limitations.

## Solutions

The shader addresses multiple GPU limitations to Horn-Schunck's optical flow

+ **Limitation:** Small changes assumption
  + Bilinear convolutions and sampling
+ **Limitation:** Brightness constancy assumption
  + Chromaticity estimation
+ **Limitation:** Iteration constraint
  + Multi-scale, symmetric Gauss-Seidel solver

## Resource Requirements

Texture | Format | Resolution | MipLevels
:-----: | :----: | :--------: | :-------:
Buffer0 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 2 | 8
Buffer1 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 2 | 8
BufferIxy | RGBA16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 2 | 8
Temporary7 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 256 | 0
Temporary6 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 128 | 0
Temporary5 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 64 | 0
Temporary4 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 32 | 0
Temporary3 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 16 | 0
Temporary2 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 8 | 0
Temporary1 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 4 | 0
Temporary0 | RG16F | BUFFER_SIZE / 2 | 0

## Pre-processing

### Color Normalization

We use a 2-dimensional color space (RG Chromaticity) instead of conventional 1-dimensional intenisity (luminance). This removes the derivatives' dependency on illumination.

```glsl
vec2 RGChromaticity = clamp(Color.xy / dot(Color.rgb, vec2(1.0)), 0.0, 1.0);
```

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
1 | Normalize | Backbuffer | Buffer0

### Convolution

We use Jorge Jimenez's pyramid convolution instead of seperated Gaussian blurs like Pete Warden's GPU optical flow. This solution is superior to conventional a Gaussian blur for multiple reasons:

+ Cache friendly due to small kernels and box sampling
+ Elimates temporal instabilities
+ Multiple texels per fetch
  + **Downsampling:** 4 texels per fetch
  + **Upsampling:** 9 texels per fetch
+ Does not require 2 textures of the same resolution
+ Easily achieve wide-radii convolutions with 2 draw-calls per level

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
2 | Downsample | Buffer0 | Temporary1
3 | Downsample | Temporary1 | Temporary2
4 | Downsample | Temporary2 | Temporary3
5 | Upsample | Temporary3 | Temporary2
6 | Upsample | Temporary2 | Temporary1
7 | Upsample | Temporary1 | Buffer0

## Derivatives

We create a pyramid of **spatial** derivates using a Sobel filter for this shader. This pyramid allows the GPU can compute weighted averages over larger spaces.

We do not need to build a pyramid for **temporal** derivatives because it does not involve spatial variation.

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
8 | Derivatives | Buffer0 | BufferIxy

## Optical Flow

We implement Horn-Schunck's optical flow algorithm with a set of modifications

+ Compute averages with a 7x7 low-pass tent filter
+ Estimate features in 2-dimensional chromaticity
+ Use multi-scale process to get initial values from neighboring pixels
+ Use symmetric Gauss-Seidel to solve linear equation at Page 8

### Low-pass Tent Filter

We use the same upsampling filter to get an average of the vector's neighborhood.

### Iterative Solver

Horn-Schunck used a Jacobi solver with Cramer's Rule for optimization on a 1-dimensional source.

However, this uses a custom solver on a 2-dimensional source.

```glsl
void OpticalFlowRG(in vec2 UV, // Estimate from coarser level
                   in vec4 Dxy, // Spatial derivatives (Rx, Ry, Gx, Gy)
                   in vec2 Dt, // Temporal derivatives (Rt, Gt)
                   in float Alpha, // Regularizer
                   out vec2 DUV)
{
    // Compute diagonal
    vec2 Aii;
    Aii.x = dot(Dxy.xz, Dxy.xz) + Alpha;
    Aii.y = dot(Dxy.yw, Dxy.yw) + Alpha;
    Aii.xy = 1.0 / Aii.xy;

    // Compute right-hand side
    vec2 RHS;
    RHS.x = dot(Dxy.xz, Dt.rg);
    RHS.y = dot(Dxy.yw, Dt.rg);

    // Compute triangle
    float Aij = dot(Dxy.xz, Dxy.yw);

    // Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (forward sweep, from 1...N)
    DUV.x = Aii.x * ((Alpha * UV.x) - RHS.x - (UV.y * Aij));
    DUV.y = Aii.y * ((Alpha * UV.y) - RHS.y - (DUV.x * Aij));

    // Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (backward sweep, from N...1)
    DUV.y = Aii.y * ((Alpha * DUV.y) - RHS.y - (DUV.x * Aij));
    DUV.x = Aii.x * ((Alpha * DUV.x) - RHS.x - (DUV.y * Aij));
}
```

### Multi-scale Estimation

*Computerphile* has a video explaining how to solve optical flow for larger movements. The solution involved iterating optical flow through a mip-chain like the following:

1. Process the coarsest level `Temporary7`
2. Use results from the coarser level to initialize optical flow values at the finer level
3. Repeat until finest level `Temporary0`

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
9 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary7
10 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary6
11 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary5
12 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary4
13 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary3
14 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary2
15 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary1
16 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, BufferIxy | Temporary0

## Post-processing

We do the same convolutions like in the prefiltering phase. However, we use the optical flow texture as input and output the result to `Buffer1`. We do not write to `Buffer0` because we will use copy that texture and use it as the previous frame after all processing

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
17 | Downsample | Temporary0 | Temporary1
18 | Downsample | Temporary1 | Temporary2
19 | Downsample | Temporary2 | Temporary3
20 | Upsample | Temporary3 | Temporary2
21 | Upsample | Temporary2 | Temporary1
22 | Upsample | Temporary1 | Buffer1

## Output

This is the final pass, where we display the processed optical flow result in the form of xy or normalized RGB.

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
23 | Display | Buffer1 | BackBuffer

## Copy

We copy `Buffer0`, to `Buffer1` after all processing. This allows us to store information from the current frame `Buffer0` and the previous frame `Buffer1` for the optical flow passes.

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
24 | Copy | Buffer0 | Buffer1
