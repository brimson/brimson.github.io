In this post, I address a shader implementation of Horn-Schunck's optical flow in 24 draw-calls.

## Limitations

### Assumptions

The original optical flow algorithm assumes the scene has brightness constancy and small changes. Therefore, it breaks on large movement (i.e. low-fps footage) and scenes with varying illumination.

### Iterations

Pixel shaders are not known for being the best for traditional stationary iterative solvers like Jacobi. These solvers use small kernels in dozens of iterations to get good results. These traditional schemes are simple, can are slow on the GPU due to fillrate and draw-call limitations.

## Solutions

The shader addresses multiple GPU limitations to Horn-Schunck's optical flow

+ **Limitation:** Small changes assumption
  + Bilinear convolutions and sampling
+ **Limitation:** Brightness constancy assumption
  + Chromaticity estimation
+ **Limitation:** Iteration constraint
  + Multi-scale, symmetric Gauss-Seidel solver

## Pre-processing

### Color Normalization

We use a 2-dimensional color space (RG Chromaticity) instead of conventional 1-dimensional intenisity (luminance). This removes the derivatives' dependency on illumination.

```glsl
vec2 RGChromaticity = clamp(Color.xy / dot(Color.rgb, vec2(1.0)), 0.0, 1.0);
```

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
1 | Normalize | Backbuffer | Buffer0

### Convolution

We use Jorge Jimenez's pyramid convolution instead of seperated Gaussian blurs like Pete Warden's GPU optical flow. This solution is superior to conventional a Gaussian blur for multiple reasons:

+ Cache friendly due to small kernels and box sampling
+ Elimates temporal instabilities
+ Multiple texels per fetch
  + **Downsampling:** 4 texels per fetch
  + **Upsampling:** 9 texels per fetch
+ Does not require 2 textures of the same resolution
+ Easily achieve wide-radii convolutions with 2 draw-calls per level

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
2 | Downsample | Buffer0 | Temporary2
3 | Downsample | Temporary2 | Temporary3
4 | Downsample | Temporary3 | Temporary4
5 | Upsample | Temporary4 | Temporary3
6 | Upsample | Temporary3 | Temporary2
7 | Upsample | Temporary2 | Buffer0

## Derivatives

We create a pyramid of **spatial** derivates using a Sobel filter for this shader. This pyramid allows the GPU can compute weighted averages over larger spaces. We do not need to build a pyramid for **temporal** derivatives because it does not rely on spatial kernels.

We pack this pyramid texture into an `RGBA16F` texture, which we can use for other shaders.

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
8 | Derivatives | Buffer0 | Buffer1

## Optical Flow

We implement Horn-Schunck's optical flow algorithm with a set of modifications

+ Use multi-scale process to get initial values from neighboring pixels
+ Average initial values with a 7x7 low-pass tent filter
+ Estimate features in 2-dimensional chromaticity
+ Use symmetric Gauss-Seidel to solve linear equation

### Iterative Solver

```glsl
// Horn-Schunck used a Jacobi solver with Cramer's Rule
// This is a symmetric Gauss-Seidel solver on a 2-dimensional source

void OpticalFlowRG(in vec2 UV, // Estimate from coarser level
                   in vec4 Di, // Spatial derivatives <Rx, Gx, Ry, Gy>
                   in vec2 Dt, // Temporal derivatives <Rt, Gt>
                   in float Alpha, // Regularizer
                   out vec2 DUV)
{
    // Compute diagonal
    vec2 Aii;
    Aii.x = dot(Di.xy, Di.xy) + Alpha;
    Aii.y = dot(Di.zw, Di.zw) + Alpha;
    Aii.xy = 1.0 / Aii.xy;

    // Compute right-hand side
    vec2 RHS;
    RHS.x = dot(Di.xy, Dt);
    RHS.y = dot(Di.zw, Dt);

    // Compute triangle
    float Aij = dot(Di.xy, Di.zw);

    // Forward Gauss-Seidel (from 1...i)
    DUV.x = Aii.x * ((Alpha * UV.x) - RHS.x - (UV.y * Aij));
    DUV.y = Aii.y * ((Alpha * UV.y) - RHS.y - (DUV.x * Aij));

    // Backward Gauss-Seidel (from i...1)
    DUV.y = Aii.y * ((Alpha * DUV.y) - RHS.y - (DUV.x * Aij));
    DUV.x = Aii.x * ((Alpha * DUV.x) - RHS.x - (DUV.y * Aij));
}
```

### Multi-scale Estimation

*Computerphile* has a video explaining how to solve optical flow for larger movements. The solution involved iterating optical flow through a mip-chain like the following:

1. Process the coarsest level `Temporary8`
2. Use results from the coarser level to initialize optical flow values at the finer level
3. Repeat until finest level `Temporary1`

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
9 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary8
10 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary7
11 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary6
12 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary5
13 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary4
14 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary3
15 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary2
16 | OpticalFlow | Buffer0, Buffer1, Buffer2 | Temporary1

## Post-processing

We do the same convolutions like in the prefiltering phase. However, we use the optical flow texture as input and output the final upsample to `Buffer1`

On pass 22, we also copy `Buffer0`, to `Buffer2`. This allows us to store information from the current convolved frame, `Buffer0`, for the next frame.

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
17 | Downsample | Temporary1 | Temporary2
18 | Downsample | Temporary2 | Temporary3
19 | Downsample | Temporary3 | Temporary4
20 | Upsample | Temporary4 | Temporary3
21 | Upsample | Temporary3 | Temporary2
22 | Upsample | Temporary2, Buffer0 | Buffer1, Buffer2

## Output

This is the final pass, where we display the processed optical flow result in the form of xy or normalized RGB.

Pass | Shader | Input | Output
:--: | :----: | :---: | :----:
23 | Display | Buffer1 | BackBuffer
